Problem: people currently have to cancel the entire visit, quickly rebook it if they want to make an amendment, and all has to be done over the phone

- Decided to focus on call centre journey as this can be tested quickly and easily
- Created a new journey flow:
    - Search for a booking (via reference number or visitor name)
    - Booking details page
        - Prisoner details
        - Visitor details
        - Date and time
    - Add or remove visitors
        - Displays all on visitor list
    - Change date and/or time
        - Date picker with available time slots
    - Review changes
    - Update booking
- To be tested next sprint 

## Testing


Journey made sense to the users in terms of how to navigate it, overall positive feedback

Areas for improvement:
- At the start of the journey, do we need to actually search via prisoner first?
- When searching for a booking, people expected to see more information about both prisoner and visitor on the booking in the search results
- There could be a better way of showing booking information, and guiding the process of making multiple changes such as visitors and date
- Further exploration of the interaction for removing a visitor - this will need to be clear that the person is no longer on the booking
- Visitors and staff express desire to a digital confirmation of the booking and reference number
