title: Creating an account to book visits
description: Exploring the idea of visitor accounts

Our first design sprint in Alpha focused on one of our riskiest assumptions, which is: 
> Can we create a visitor profile or account to allow us to identify a visitor through verified credentials?

The business requirements for visitor profiles or accounts are to:

- record accurate visitor information
- verify identities of people before they visit 
- avoid duplicate records in the system

For friends and family of people in prison, we need to design a service that they trust and find easy to use. Research in the project’s Discovery phase also identified a pain point for friends and family around not being informed when they have been approved and can book their first visit.


We also wanted to explore:

- Will a requirement for an account stop some friends and family from visiting?
- Could it act as a barrier for online bookings?
- Do friends and family see any benefits in having an account?

## What we did

We reviewed the user needs related to booking a prison visit and the team’s previous work to map out a possible to-be journey for account creation.

After defining the problem and our assumptions, we mapped out 3 approaches:

- Mandatory accounts with a separate registration journey
- Mandatory accounts with registration as part of the booking journey
- Optional accounts with registration as part of the booking journey

We developed these ideas into prototype booking journeys for:

- first-time users who register as part of the booking journey
- returning visitors who sign in to use the service

These prototypes will allow us to test if mandatory accounts are a barrier for online booking that might stop or exclude people from using the service. 

We also created designs to allow account holders to add people to a visit from a list of additional visitors. This will allow us to test our assumption that not having to input the same information each time they book is a benefit for friends and family users.


## Testing

We tested the prototypes with ten people who currently visit prisons. We ran three remote research sessions with individuals. Four sessions with a total of seven participants were held at the visitor centre at HMP YOI Brinsford.

The findings from this round of research were:

- The information required and the reasons for it were understood
- Even for those relatively new to prison visiting, prisoner’s details were easily recalled from memory, including the prison number
- None of the form fields caused confusion and users could complete them with little or no hesitation
- The concept of an account was understood and the value recognised - but this was based on ’best guesses’ about the method of getting an account
