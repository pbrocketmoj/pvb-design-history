## Service design - register a visitor

Ran a short value mapping exercise

Want to explore these concepts:
- Visitor registers their details and makes a request that the prisoner approves
- Prisoner supplies a unique code which allows a visitor to register their details
- Next steps are currently undefined - we know we want to test these things but not sure how/when/where

## Testing of the amendment journey

Next steps:
- Making the cancel screens
- I’ve experimented with some different options for amending, including a more form-like journey that allows the user to edit visitors and time and date in one continuous path
- Also exploring what the booking summary page looks like
- Improving interaction for removing visitors
- Possibly beginning journey with search for prisoner - they do this currently, not sure if our journey should be the same

## Visit to HMP Hewell

We spoke to staff who work in the visitor centre, and prison staff who run the visits

Some interesting findings were:
- Security checks are done on the information provided by the prisoner - if it is found to be wrong after the visitor comes for their first visit, they have to re-do the checks
- Support for the uploading of an ID (like in purple visits) to make it easier for staff 
- Lots of issues with communication with the call centre - information is not understood and problems arise
     - Like cancelling the visits for an entire wing rather than just a few cells (a ‘spur’ they called it) when there was a covid case
- They are very proactive and want ownership over their guidance and communications with the public
