# This is a heading in H1 - we don't actually need H1 because we already have a title
Here are some words that would be an introduction.

## This is a heading in H2 - sub-section of the post

Some more words - this time I've left a space between the heading and the paragraph but I'm not sure if that does anything.

1. first item
2. second
3. third

- list one
- list two

**this should be in bold**

*this should be italicised*

> this should be a blockquote

`this should appear code-like`
